// Import -> ES2015 feature used to import functions, object, etc
// Decorator -> Adds more behavior to our class from outside the class, it mush be declared before the class
// Modules -> Modules are how we organize our application in Angular, Every Angular application must have a "root module", which we'll need to launch it. One app may have multiples modules, but we need to declare a "root module"
// Component -> Funtion we will use to create components
// NgModule -> Angular 2 you must specifically say which components youâ€™re going to be using in your app.
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({

// selector -> CSS selector that tells Angular to create and insert an instance of this component where it finds a <my-app> tag in parent HTML.
// templateUrl -> module-relative address of this component's HTML template, shown above.
// providers: array of dependency injection providers for services that the component requires. 
// This is one way to tell Angular that the component's constructor requires a Service.
