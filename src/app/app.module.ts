// Import -> ES2015 feature used to import functions, object, etc
// Decorator -> Adds more behavior to our class from outside the class, it mush be declared before the class
// Modules -> Modules are how we organize our application in Angular, Every Angular application must have a "root module", which we'll need to launch it. 
// One app may have multiples modules, but we need to declare a "root module"
// Component -> Funtion we will use to create components
// NgModule -> Angular 2 you must specifically say which components youâ€™re going to be using in your app.

// BrowserModule -> Module we need for running/rendering Angular websites.
// It contains code shared for browser execution (DOM thread, WebWorker).
// Ahead-of-Time pre-compiled version of application being sent to the browser. Which usually means a significantly smaller package being sent to the browser.

// imports -> other modules whose exported classes are needed by component templates declared in this module.
// declarations -> the view classes that belong to this module. Angular has three kinds of view classes: components, directives, and pipes.
// exports -> the subset of declarations that should be visible and usable in the component templates of other modules.
// bootstrap -> the main application view, called the root component, that hosts all other app views. 
// imports -> other modules whose exported classes are needed by component templates declared in this module.
// providers -> creators of services that this module contributes to the global collection of services; they become accessible in all parts of the app.
// bootstrap -> the main application view, called the root component, that hosts all other app views. 
// Only the root module should set this bootstrap property.

// Every decoration function decorates a class
